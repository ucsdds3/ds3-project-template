# DS3 Project Template

A clean starter template for data science and machine learning projects at UC San Diego's DS3.

## What this template includes

- A sensible folder structure for notebooks, source code, data, and outputs
- A Python environment file for quick setup
- A .gitignore tailored for secrets, notebooks, and generated artifacts
- A small starter package and test example

## Suggested repository structure

```text
.
├── README.md
├── .env.example
├── .gitignore
├── requirements.txt
├── notebooks/
│   └── README.md
├── src/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── example.py
├── frontend/
│   └── README.md
├── infra/
│   └── README.md
├── data/
│   ├── raw/
│   └── processed/
├── results/
├── models/
└── tests/
```

- `frontend/` is for UI/UX code and web app assets.
- `infra/` is for deployment scripts, cloud config, and infrastructure as code for AWS/GCP.

## Quick start

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   **.env files are generally not shared on GitHub; they are included here only as an example template.**
4. Start working in notebooks or in the src package.

## Repository guidelines

- Keep notebooks for exploration and visualization.
- Put reusable logic in src so notebooks stay readable.
- Do not commit secrets, API keys, or large data files.
- Use clear filenames and short, documented functions.
- Add tests for any core logic that will be reused.

## Git and GitHub workflow for DS3 projects

Using Git and GitHub well is just as important as writing good code. A clean workflow makes collaboration easier and helps the project stay organized.

### 1. Use GitHub Issues for tracking work

Create an Issue for each task, bug, experiment, or feature request. Keep each issue focused and include:

- a short title
- a clear description of the work
- acceptance criteria if relevant
- labels such as bug, enhancement, documentation, or blocked

Example workflow:
- one issue for data cleaning
- one issue for model training
- one issue for documentation updates

### 2. Use branches to separate work

Each person or feature should usually work in its own branch. This prevents people from overwriting each other's changes.

Common branch commands:

```bash
git branch
git checkout -b feature/my-task
git checkout main
git branch -d feature/my-task
```

What they mean:
- `git branch` shows existing branches
- `git checkout -b feature/my-task` creates and switches to a new branch
- `git checkout main` switches back to the main branch
- `git branch -d feature/my-task` deletes a branch after it is merged

### 3. Use pull requests to merge code into main

When work is complete, open a Pull Request (PR) from your branch into `main`. A PR is the place to review changes, discuss issues, and confirm everything is ready.

Important rule:
- Only project managers or mentors should approve pull requests.
- Students should contribute code, but approvals should be handled by the designated maintainers.

### 4. Basic Git commands and what they mean

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
git status
git add <file>
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your change"
git push origin <branch-name>
git log
git merge <branch-name>
git rebase <branch-name>
```

What they mean:
- `git clone` copies a repository from GitHub to your local machine
- `git status` shows which files changed and what branch you are on
- `git add` stages files for commit
- `git commit` saves staged changes with a message
- `git push` uploads your local commits to GitHub
- `git log` shows recent commit history
- `git merge` combines another branch into your current branch
- `git rebase` reapplies your commits on top of another branch and can help keep history cleaner

### 5. Recommended team habits

- Pull the latest changes before starting work
- Keep commits small and descriptive
- Avoid committing large data files or secrets
- Open a PR early for feedback, not only at the end
- Resolve merge conflicts carefully and communicate with the team

### 6. Example workflow

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/data-cleaning
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Add initial data cleaning script"
git push origin feature/data-cleaning
```

Then open a Pull Request on GitHub and wait for approval from the appropriate project manager or mentor.

## Notes for DS3 projects

This template is intentionally simple so students can focus on the science instead of setup. As projects grow, teams can add:

- experiment tracking
- model checkpoints
- deployment scripts
- cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP) in `infra/`
- frontend UI/UX code in `frontend/`
- CI checks
- docs pages
